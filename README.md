# 📌 Project: YouTube Data Analysis

## 📄 About the Project:
This project focuses on analyzing YouTube data to uncover insights about channels, videos, and user engagement.  
The data was **collected using the YouTube Data API v3**, allowing real-time extraction of channel and video details.  
Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, I performed data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and interpreted key metrics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python 🐍
- YouTube Data API v3 🌐
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📈
- Seaborn 🎨
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 🔥 Key Features:
- Web scraped live YouTube data via **YouTube Data API v3**.
- Imported and preprocessed raw YouTube data for analysis.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends and patterns.
